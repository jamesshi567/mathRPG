# mathRPG

Hello!

This is an RPG style game in 2D. The battle mechanics of this game, such as attacking, will revolve around solving simple math problems correctly. This game is mainly intended as a fun way for children to build a solid foundation in arithmetic.

This is very much a work in progress, and many things will be implemented. Upcoming high-priority changes include, but are not limited to:
- Completing the graphics to draw a complete level map
- Debugging the collision system
- Adding enemies and other characters (as sprites)
- Implementing the attack mechanics

Check back often as this project will likely change a lot throughout the coming weeks.

There are 5 main files. Please ensure that all 5 .py files are placed in the same directory when running this on your personal device.
